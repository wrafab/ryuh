  <h><strong>Design Rules and Limitations for Makerbot Replicator 5th Gen Printers</strong></h>
  <p>The Makerbot Replicator 5th Gen has a 10 in x 8 in x 6 in build plate, which is the dimension limitation.<br>
    Also, the Makerbot can connect to USB and WiFi for connectivity. The minimum depth per layer is 100 microns (0.004 inches), <br>
    and usable materials include ABS and PLA thermplastics. Being a 3D printer, the Makerbot uses additive manufacturing to make objects,<br>
    meaning it is more detailed and can create hollow areas in an object. Compared to subtractive manufacturing, additive<br>
    also uses less than a subtracyive printer, but subtractive is cheaper and has a wider variety of usable materials.<br>
    Finally, additive printers cannot get as smooth of an edge as subtractive printers (CNC milling), as they have to have <br>
    a minimum layer depth. <img src="makerbotprinter.jpg" width="350" height="350" align="right"></p>

  <h><strong>3D Model of My Head on a Pedestal</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>So, I used 3D Knockout Scanner and with the help of Mr. Gerber, scanned my head.<br>
    The head was a .obj file so I put it in AutoDesk meshimixer and imported a pedestal file with it.<br>
    I had to fix some holes and bloated parts of the head and append the head and the pedestal together.<br>
    Then I exported it as a STL file and put it in Makerbot in order to print the model<br>
    On the bottom, you can see how the 3D model print turned out.<br>

  <h><strong>Making an Object that can't Be Made Subtractively</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I thought about it a bit and made an object that can't be made subtractively.<br>
  It is a hollow sphere with a hole in it that is within a cube that has open circular faces.<br>
  It acts kind of like a fidget cube.<br>
