  <h><strong>Final Project - Solar Powered Android Charger with Case</strong></h>
  <br>
  <br
  <p>1. Describe your project.<br>
  My project is a solar powered android charger. It is very small and portable. You just put your usb into the port. I used: soldering, auto cad design, laser cutting and 3D printing for this project.<br>
2. What equipment and materials did you use to create the project.<br>
I used a 4v small solar panel, a USB charging circuit, 1N914 diode, AA chargeable batteries, AA battery holders, wires, solders and used a 3D printer to print the case out.<br>
3. How much time did you spend working on the project?<br>
I spent around 2-3 days working on the project in order to get it working, make and fit the case properly, and to solder everything nicely.<br>
4. What settings and configurations did you use on each machine.<br>
Nothing much. Just the normal settings for the 3D printer and just turned on the solder.<br>
5. What did you learn from this project?<br>
I learned to solder, how circuits work and designing your own things.<br>
6. Please document each step of your project including photographs and include ALL project files.<br>

  This is the internals of my solar panel charger that I could not finish in time because the diode I needed did not come in on time.<br>

  This is the front of what the "finished" product would look like. I designed the case to fit the battery holders.<br>

  This is the side where you can plug in your usb. I made the hole on the side.<br>
