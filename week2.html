  <title> Photoshop/PDIP/Dye Sublimation </title>
  <h><strong>Photoshop/PDIP/Dye Sublimation</strong></h>
  <p>For week 2 in Digital Engineering, I learned to use photoshop and printed out my own custom shirt using the Makerbot printer. <br>
     After creating the design that I wanted (below), I went on PDIP to put where the image was going to be on the shirt. <br>
    Then I printed the t-shirt and below are the images of the stages. <br>
    After this, I started on dye sublimation and I decided to do a tie. <br>
    I also created a design that was going to go on the tie first on CorrelDraw. <br>
    Then I watched the instruction video on how to do dye sublimation on a tie. <br>
    Below are the images of my work and the finished tie. <br>
