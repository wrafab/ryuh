  <title> Fusion 360 - CAD </title>
  <h><strong>Fusion 360 - CAD</strong></h>
  <p>For week 1 in Digital Engineering, we started on a CAD or Computer Aided Design software called Autodesk Fusion 360.<br>
    We were given choices on what to make and I decided to make a stamp. <br>
    The issue that I first faced when I was trying to make a text stamp was that it was very complicated to mirror image the text on to the stamp itself. <br>
    So I decided to go with image tracing, but I realized that I would have to make rectangles instead of lines. <br>
    It was very annoying since I traced the whole image out with just lines. <br>
    So I just decided to go with a simple stamp that says, "No". <br>
    It also has the letter H on the top of the stamp that stands for totally not my name.<br>
    After I created the stamp in Fusion 360 and saved it as a STL file, I went onto MakerBot Print. <br>
    I then scaled it down and rotated it with supports so that the stamp part would be nice and clean. <br></p>

  <h><strong>What I learned</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I learned that doing mirror flipped text is very hard to do since you have to sketch all the lines out.<br>
    The pictures just take a bit more time since you have to draw out the thick outlines so that the stamp would work.<br>
