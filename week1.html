  <h><strong>Fusion 360 - CAD</strong></h>
  <p>For week 1 in Digital Engineering, we started on a CAD or Computer Aided Design software called Autodesk Fusion 360.<br>
    We were given choices on what to make and I decided to make a stamp. <br>
    The issue that I first faced when I was trying to make a text stamp was that it was very complicated to mirror image the text on to the stamp itself. <br>
    So I decided to go with image tracing, but I realized that I would have to make rectangles instead of lines. <br>
    It was very annoying since I traced the whole image out with just lines. <br>
    So I just decided to go with a simple stamp that says, "No". <br> </p>
