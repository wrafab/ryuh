  <p>Raspeberry Pi was pretty fun.<br>
    I got to learn how Python syntax worked and the fact that you can boot an OS from a small $35 thing was amazing.<br>
    I played Minecraft Pi on it and it was not too bad.<br>
    I also put electronic parts in a breadboard and connected it to raspberry pi.<br>
    The LED and the camera was pretty cool.<br>
    <br>
    I learned that in physical computing you can use GPIO pins and for the code also.<br>
    I learned that what you put on your code appears in physical form such as LEDs.<br>
    <br>
    Scratch and Python is important because it can code what happens on Raspberry Pi.<br>
    You can control LEDs, GPIO pins and such.<br>
    <br>
    My favorite raspberry pi project was the making pixel art on LED because you could put anything you want on it with different color.<br>
