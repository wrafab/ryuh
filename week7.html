  <p>Soldering was pretty fun.<br>
    I had to heat the solder up and wet the sponge.<br>
    I wrapped a metal long thing around my hand so that soldering can be easier.<br>
    I got my project which was the flashing lights.<br>
    I followed the instructions and put electronic parts into the plate thing.<br>
    I soldered and cut off the extra metal parts.<br>
    I put in the battery and it worked.<br>
