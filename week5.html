  <h><strong>Making Vinyl Stickers</strong></h>
  <p>To make vinyl stickers, I first had to get to CorelDraw and import the images that I chose.<br>
    I chose a hot dog and a weiner dog shadow since vinyl stickers are in one color.<br>
    I created a line bitmap of it then got it cut out at the Roland Cutting Machine.<br>
    After that, I had to take the excess sticker off and stick transfer tape on the remaning desired sticker part.<br>
    Then I transfered the vinyl stickers over onto my notebook.<br>
    They look pretty good on the bottom.<br>

  <h><strong>Full Color Cut Contour Stickers</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>So I opened CorelDraw and made bitmaps of the two images I wanted stickers of.<br>
    Then I exported as an eps file and opened them up on the computer connected to the Roland 540i.<br>
    For the ForsenE, I powerclipped it into a circle to make a circular sticker.<br>
    I just made the shape of a MonkaS because it's cool.<br>
    I cut out around the stickers so that it looks nicer.<br>

  <h><strong>Molding from a Negative</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I got the head scan model from the previous rotation and cut it in half.<br>
    I tilted the head a bit so that it looks cool.<br>
    I went on the milling machine and went through all the settings and steps and such.<br>
    The first mill apparently was a path thing so it looked all rough.<br>
    The second one turned out way nicer.<br>
    Below are the molds and the chocolate things.<br>
