  <h><strong>Making Vinyl Stickers</strong></h>
  <p>To make vinyl stickers, I first had to get to CorelDraw and import the images that I chose.<br>
    I chose a hot dog and a weiner dog shadow since vinyl stickers are in one color.<br>
    I created a line bitmap of it then got it cut out at the Roland Cutting Machine.<br>
    After that, I had to take the excess sticker off and stick transfer tape on the remaning desired sticker part.<br>
    Then I transfered the vinyl stickers over onto my notebook.<br>
    They look pretty good on the bottom.<br>

  <h><strong>Making an Object that can't Be Made Subtractively</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I thought about it a bit and made an object that can't be made subtractively.<br>
  It is a hollow sphere with a hole in it that is within a cube that has open circular faces.<br>
  It acts kind of like a fidget cube.<br>
