  <h><strong>3D Model of My Head on a Pedestal</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>So, I used 3D Knockout Scanner and with the help of Mr. Gerber, scanned my head.<br>
    The head was a .obj file so I put it in AutoDesk meshimixer and imported a pedestal file with it.<br>
    I had to fix some holes and bloated parts of the head and append the head and the pedestal together.<br>
    Then I exported it as a STL file and put it in Makerbot in order to print the model<br>
    On the bottom, you can see how the 3D model print turned out.<br>

  <h><strong>Making an Object that can't Be Made Subtractively</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I thought about it a bit and made an object that can't be made subtractively.<br>
  It is a hollow sphere with a hole in it that is within a cube that has open circular faces.<br>
  It acts kind of like a fidget cube.<br>
