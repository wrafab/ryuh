  <h><strong>Making the Skateboard</strong></h>
  <p>I made a CorelDraw file that matched the dimensions of the board.<br>
    I decided to laser cut onto my skateboard so I put an image then saved the file.<br>
    I got the very bottom boardnad laser cut my image onto it.<br>
    Then, I got a partner to help out on gluing all the board together.<br>
    I put the glued boards in a bag with a mesh and the curve mold and put tar tape so that so air leaks.<br>
    However, the bag leaked and I wasted 20 minutes of my life.<br>
    I re-taped it and pumped it so that the edges get curved due to the curve mold.<br>
    I took it out and one side of the skateboard was curved and the other was not really.<br>
    Then I finished the skateboard off by grinding all the edges and sanding down the top and bottom.<br>
