  <h><strong>Making A Cardboard Box with Designs on It</strong></h>
  <p>I went to the website called MakerCase and decided that I wanted to make a cube with finger joints.<br>
    I got the file, opened it on CorelDraw in order to vector and rastor on it.<br>
    To vector, I put some text on the box and made it hairlined.<br>
    To rastor, I created a bitmap of an image I wanted to make.<br>
    Then I went to the laser cutter, focused it and watched it as it cut out my box.<br>
    You can see the assembled box on the bottom.<br>

  <h><strong>Making a Pressfit Kit</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I thought about it a bit and realized that I just needed to make rectangular holes around shapes the same size.<br>
  So I did that on CorelDraw and made it hairline so that the laser cutter would cut the pieces out.<br>
  You can see how it fits together nicely.<br>

  <img src="press2.jpg" width="350" height="350"><br></p>
  
  <h><strong>Wrist Band Design</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>So, I used CorelDraw again, using a canvas the same size as the band.<br>
    I put the text on it and did not hairline so that it would rastor.<br>
    The text turned out a bit higher than I expected, but it was still pretty good.<br>

  <h><strong>Laser Cutting on a Cup</strong></h>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>I had to get a special thing in order to laser cut on a cup.<br>
    I laid the cup on the special machinery and make it flat so that the laser can cut straight on the cup.<br>
    It turned out the image I used was too low resolution, but when you hold it up to the light, you can see the details.<br>
    So I still like my pogchamp cup.<br>
